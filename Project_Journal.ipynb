    "# Thesis Question\n",
    "- does daily use of personal social media (instagram etc..) increase anxiety rates in 14-16 yr olds\n",
    "\n",
    "# Phase 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "- Teenages aged 14-16 who use Instagram daily have higher rates of anxiety then those who dont use Instagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mind Map\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "### Functional\n",
    "- Use Case: Inform Users and provide visual representations of rates of anxiety in teenage Instagram users.\n",
    "- UI: Provide a text based interactive UI that allows for switching between country view, as in rates of the above for America, Australia, England, etc...\n",
    "- Errors: Handles errors such as empty data or incorrect formatting by removing them or repllacing them with recogniseable and skippable 'filler' values.\n",
    "- Output: The data should output as a matplotlib visual plot graph of data. (I might make it downloadable but not sure if i'll have time)\n",
    "### Non-Functional\n",
    "- Speed: Should be able to fetch data from the datasets and return it as a visual representation within 2 seconds.\n",
    "- Reliability: Should not error at all.\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "- Actor: User who wants the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Goal: To understand existing data with data visualisation using MatplotLib through our UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preconditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The dataset has already been downloaded and correctly placed into the same folder as the script by the system admin/programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The user has the correct permissions to access all files and can run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The user knows what they're looking for in the datasets, and what they want visualised.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Main Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "User runs the program and is presented with a clean, consise text-based menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "User is told briefly about the overall idea of the datasets.\n",
    "User selects one of the following:\n",
    "1. Single Dataset Visualisation Mode (Displays a single dataset visualised using MatPlotLib)\n",
    "2. 2 Dataset Comparison Mode (Displays 2 side-by-side datasets visualised using MatPlotLib)\n",
    "\n",
    "After Selecting, \n",
    "If option 1 was chosen, Ask which country they want to look at and want visualised\n",
    "If option 2 was chosen, do the same as option 1, but ask twice for the two different datasets to compare.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Selecting the Country/Countries,\n",
    "System performs the actions requested and outputs a simple to read data visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Postconditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "User had viewed and understood the data that was visualised.\n",
    "\n",
    "User selects to finish viewing using a text-based interface and program returns to the first selection screen."
